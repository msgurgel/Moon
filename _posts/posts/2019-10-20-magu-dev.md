Welcome to the first post of magu.dev! Check out any side projects I've worked on in [Projects][projects] and more post like this in [Posts][posts].

## Hosting magu.dev

magu.dev is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator, and its hosted on GitHub Pages. The theme I'm using is a slightly modified version of the [Moon](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon) theme. You can find the source code for this website by clicking the button below.
