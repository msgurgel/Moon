## The Challenge

The 4x4 Challenge showcases and celebrates the entrepreneurial and technical skills that Conestoga students possess. The event takes place over Student Success Week; the 2018 4X4 Challenge takes place February 27 to March 2, 2018. The 4x4 Challenge gives participating students the opportunity to explore the art of solving real-world problems through innovation and compete for prizes.

The first 4x4 Challenge obtained its name from a very simple and modest target back in 2012:

> A minimum of four Conestoga College student teams will have four days to design and implement solutions from a pool of industry-provided projects, or their own unique ideas. Thus the name "4x4 Challenge".

The theme for the 4x4 Challenge 2018 was **Solutions for Smart Cities and Communities**.

## The Problem

- **Infrastructure Issues are expensive for the Kitchener/Waterloo Region:** Every year, the city of Kitchener spends about $600,000 to fix potholes alone. Furthermore, an additional $25,000 is allocated every year for lawsuits resulting from injures related to broken infrastructure.

- **Finding issues in infrastructure takes time:** Sidewalks are inspected annually, and roads are inspected for deficiencies regularly depending on their class. However, if obstacles or hazards are introduced soon after an inspection, the city won’t know about it until the next inspection.

- **Citizens aren’t incentivized to help out their community:** Other apps or reporting systems don’t reward users.

## The Solution

**Everyday Heroes:** An app that streamlines the infrastructure issue reporting process and engages the community to help the city.

### Features

- Upload Pictures and/or descriptions of potholes, road blockages, cracked sidewalks, and other problems in the local infrastructure
- See other people’s report and be aware of any issues in the community
- Provide direct feedback to the Kitchener management to decrease the time it will take to fix infrastructure problems
- Reward points are offered for reporting infrastructure issues around the city

## How It Works

### Front-end

- Adobe PhoneGap framework was used to develop our solution. It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build an application that can be used across multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android and Windows Phone.
- jQuery and jQuery Mobile was implemented in order to achieve overall look and feel of the application.

### Back-end

- Linux Apache server, hosting MySQL database.
- Communication with the app was performed through JSON objects, using PHP scripts.

## Current Features

- **Map** – Displays the active infrastructure issues around the city.

- **Leaderboard** – Shows how many points the top ten users have accumulated.

- **Create Report** – Report an issue to the city, so it can be fixed.
